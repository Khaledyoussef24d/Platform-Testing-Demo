# Example Terraform Variables Configuration
# Copy this file to terraform.tfvars and customize as needed

# LocalStack Configuration (for local testing - DEFAULT)
# Use this for testing without AWS credentials or costs
use_localstack     = true
localstack_endpoint = "http://localhost:4566"

# AWS Configuration (for real AWS deployment)
# Uncomment and set use_localstack = false to deploy to AWS
# use_localstack     = false

# Common Configuration
aws_region         = "us-east-1"
bucket_name        = "example-prisma-demo-bucket"
vpc_id             = "vpc-12345678"  # Update with your VPC ID for AWS deployment
admin_ip_cidr      = "10.0.0.0/8"   # Update with your admin IP range

# Notes:
# - LocalStack mode: No AWS credentials needed
# - AWS mode: Ensure AWS credentials are configured (AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY)
# - LocalStack uses dummy credentials automatically
# - For AWS deployment, update vpc_id to match your actual VPC
